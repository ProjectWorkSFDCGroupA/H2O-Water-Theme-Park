This is a Salesforce DX project --- Water Theme Park Management System.
This is mostly the customer side of things where you can signup/login, view rides, get details, book a package, view ticket history of a particular customer etc.
I did this on my own after two months of Salesforce training under Cognizant.

P.S. Ignore components such as loginForm and forgotPassword and only one apex controller is used named "ThemeParkController"
